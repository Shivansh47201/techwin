      content:
        "A single-frequency fiber laser is engineered to operate on a single longitudinal mode, delivering a very narrow spectral line with minimal frequency drift. This behavior is achieved through advanced cavity design, precise stabilization mechanisms, and carefully optimized optical components that suppress mode hopping and competing modes. Core properties include extremely narrow linewidth, high spectral purity, long coherence length, minimal phase noise, and stable wavelength output over time. These characteristics support high-precision industrial, metrology, sensing, and scientific processes that cannot tolerate frequency instability. The 2.0μm Industrial Single-Frequency Fiber Laser is designed around these principles to deliver dependable optical performance for long-term use in demanding environments.",
