  shortDescription:
    "The 266 nm wavelength conversion laser is a high-performance narrow-linewidth deep-UV laser, created by integrating a proprietary narrow-linewidth fiber laser with highly efficient and stable frequency-conversion technology. It offers exceptional beam quality, strong power stability, and reliable long-term operation. With its ability to maintain narrow linewidth and generate fourth-harmonic output, this laser is well-suited for semiconductor processing, materials analysis, and other precision applications.",
